# MakerSpace Taster Session: Raspberry Pi
  
Thursday, 22 June 2023  
Senate House MakerSpace  

In this session, we will introduce you to a lightweight and flexible computing solution called Raspberry Pi. These miniature computers are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and can be fully customised. For example, they can be used for online data harvesting, to run sensors, or to run an exhibit display station.
 
During the session, we will provide an overview of the Raspberry Pi approach to computing and give you the chance to try setting up one up yourself. No experience required.

* [Blog in a box](https://inabox.blog), a quick and easy way of installing WordPress on a Raspberry Pi. WordPress is a blogging software but can also be used for collecting data, taking notes, etc. Note: This is an unhosted local instance of WordPress and to make your website available online would require further steps.
